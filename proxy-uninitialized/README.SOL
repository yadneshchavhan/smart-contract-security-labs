Uninitialized Proxy Vulnerability

Description
When using upgradeable contracts, constructors do not run in the proxy
context. If the `initialize()` function is left public and unprotected,
any user can call it before the intended admin, gaining ownership.

Proof of Concept
1. Deploy the proxy pointing to `LogicV1` without calling `initialize()`.
2. From an attacker account, call `initialize(attackerAddress)`.
3. Observe that `owner` is set to the attacker.
4. The attacker can now call privileged functions.

Impact
Complete administrative takeover of the proxy contract.

Recommendation
Use an `initializer` modifier to ensure `initialize()` can only be called once,
and disable initializers in the implementation constructor.
